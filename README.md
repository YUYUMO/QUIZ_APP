# QUIZ_APP

Back in the JavaScript saddle! üêé I've been refreshing my skills and recently built a quiz app, focusing on solidifying my understanding of core JS concepts.

This project gave me practical experience with:

- JavaScript conditionals and booleans for logic.
- Dynamically updating the HTML of specific elements using document.querySelector and innerHTML.
- It is a simple quiz on news and political leaders.
- Using innerHTML with template literals to show the correct result took a little debugging, but was a great learning experience.
- It was a rewarding experience to see these elements come together in a functional application.
